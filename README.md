# Learning Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R
This is my repository for learning an introduction to statistical analysis of spatio-temporal data with hands-on applications of the statistical methods using R software through the **Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R** book by [Wikle et al. 2019](https://spacetimewithr.org/book). For more information about the book, please head over to the [website](https://spacetimewithr.org/index) and its accompanying GitHub [repository](https://github.com/andrewzm/STRbook).
